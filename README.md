- Two types of components.
  - Standard components (SC) that are pre made by dev team
  - Custom components (CC) made by the user.

## Custom Components Concept

- User uses UI to create CC.
- CC details (ie params) are stored in .json file for now, later written to database.
- CC are "disposable" ... they are so easy to make there is no need to edit them. Destroy and make a new one.
- CC has the following properties:
  - Name: User defined name. Probably limit character amount.... does not need to be unique.
  - Unique ID: UUID
  - Created By: Value will be either "system" (used in SC) and will be the logged in users name or id or something. This value will be used when loading in the users dashboard.
  - Data Source: Data Source (right now) is in json file with name, id, and url.... the idea is this will point back to that information on where the components data is to come from.
  - Display Type: (This name sucks) Predetermined component such as bar chart, data table, pie chart...etc... This is essentially the container and format to display the data from the data source.

### POSSIBLE OTHER PROPERTIES: Unsure if these are needed or should be included.

- Background Color
- Text Color
- Font Size
- Height
- Width
- The values of these properties are defaulted to the current theme... allowing the user to set custom background, text colors could certainly be of value.... I think.... Other options such as shadow and border colors and sizes could also be set to override the defaults if desired....

  - ‚ö†Ô∏è However.... there would need to be a "default" type value... currently the value for each is whatever the theme is at the time. When that is written to the json file that data is static... there has to be a way for the render engine to know which ones should defer to the theme and which ones should use the static values/

The basic concept is that the json data for the user is returned and looped over. Foreach a component is created from the data in the json and then wrapped in a DashCard component (_name for now... not looking to refactor right now_). The components are not components in the traditional sense of being located in ` src/components/component.svelte` but are created on load. This might be the downfall of the entire project since Svelte compiles.

First goal will be to create these components from a sample .json file with no data sources. Once that `magic` happens - we will move on to figuring out dynamic data sources. I am thinking maybe this needs to be a SSR solution, but I am guessing as I am not knowledge enough about when to use SSR or CSR. Only one way to learn... lets go üöÄ

_(1/12/2024 1010 hours)_ : I guess I was already do that before...

_*NEXT STEP*_

- figure out how to pass the data source props from the dataSources.json file into each "sub-component" of the CC.
  - For that let's go back the jibjab page where we are creating these components, grab that value when we import the dataSources file, and assign the url value as part of the element that is written to the json file.
  - This will presents an issue to address down the road when using actual API sources that require auth...

_(1/23/2024 1144 hours)_ : created an API endpoint that queries a mysql and returns data, and even populates it in the data table. üÜí

The data table `<th>` values had to be hard coded to make sense.... these values should be part of the component object I think. Back to the jibjab.

- This would also allow limiting the data field could. Its a dashboard card...so probably three?
- I think the values available for the user to pick from could come from the dataSources.json file üí°üí°üí°üí°

This is working! Holy smokes!!! We have some momentum now!

## IDEA üí°

I think for now, to solve the API issue, what if there is an API endpoint for each data source AND query, rather than figure out how to make them dynamically - and then allow the user to select from the list ... I think I had this idea already.... idk.

| DataSource -> ViewTypes -> DataPoints <br/>
|\_ViewTypes available for DataSource <br/>
|\_DataPoints available for DataSource\ViewType <br/>
|\_API Endpoint for DataSource\ViewType with DataPoints passed a params <br/>

Something like that. Held in json file like so:

```
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "3CX Calls",
    "description": "3cx Call Data",
    "url": "../api/getEmployeeData",
    "viewTypes": {
      "DataTable": {
        "CustomComponent": "DataTable",
        "dataPoints": ["Employee Number", "Employee Name", "Employee Extension"]
      },
      "VertBarChart": {
        "CustomComponent": ""VertBarChart",
        "dataPoints": ["TotalEmployees", "TotalExtensions", "ExtensionCountByDept"]
      }
    },
  }
]
```
